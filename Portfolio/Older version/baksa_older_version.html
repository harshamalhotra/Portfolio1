  <p><strong>In the first stage, I conducted a <a href="images/Baksa-Comp-analysis.pdf">competitive analysis</a> between Evernote, Google Keep and Things by using these products myself, by reading press articles about them and by reading their reviews in app store. Here are some things that I learnt from this:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Evernote while feature-full is also pretty complex to use and is slightly hard to use for new users.</li>
    <li>Evernote has a limit on free storage per user, after which user needs to purchase more storage.</li>
    <li>Things has a good system to associate tasks with tags.</li>
    <li>Things is fairly expensive</li>
    <li>Things has a feature of reminders about tasks that several people liked.</li>
    <li>Google Keep is very simple and easy to use for a narrow use case of making lists</li>
  </ul> 
  <p><strong>Next, I wanted to understand my potential users. So I created a survey and circulated it among my FB friends. The filter question filtered off those people who don't store their content on any software. I then asked the remaining people (about 10 in number) questions about how they were currently writing and saving their content. Some of the most important insights that I gained for the survey are as follows:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Many people were using both their laptop and smartphones to manage their content. Some were also using their iPads. This taught me that the website needed to work for various screen sizes and hence needed to be responsive. </li>
    <li>Most common use case was to store images.</li>
    <li>Available storage in free membership was important for people, especially since they were storing lots of images. I also found that some people had hit.</li>
    <li>Many people relied on browser bookmarks to store their links but often forgot about them. It was also hard to find a given a link.</li>
    <li>Given that their current solutions were complex, people needed a simple product so that they could just focus on their work instead of learning to use the product.</li>
    <li>Writing documents was not a common use case but it was very important for a couple of people.</li>
    <li>People were sensitive about never losing the content they were writing and hence wanted an autosave functionality for their documents. </li>
  </ul>

  Based on the surveys, it was clear that my potential user base had different and sometimes competing requirements. For instance, some power users cared about writing documents whereas most others cared about storing images. So I crafted <a href="images/baksa-persona3.png">user personas</a> based on my research to ensure that I was designing for all the potential users.

  <div class="desc-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
  <p>I wanted the users to think of the product as a box since it can store all their content. I played all around with various variations of the word “box” and decided to call it “baksa” since it sounds like box and is also the word for “box” in Hindi.</p>
  <p>I designed three different logos — one with just a box and the other two with a “b” inside a box. I ended up choosing the one with just a box because I felt that it will inspire stronger brand recognition. </p>
  <p>I wanted Baksa to feel professional, trustworthy and yet slightly playful to keep the users engaged. I decided to use Helvetica Neue font for the text since it is known ride the line between classic and modern, conservative and edgy, or elegant and relaxed. It is very popular within corporations for the same reason.</p>
  <p>I chose Garamond for headings. Garamond typefaces are popular and often used, particularly for printing books. </p>
  <p>I chose a blueish color theme because blue is seen as trustworthy, dependable and committed.</p>

      <p>Based on business requirements and the user research, I determined a list of user stories that I needed to design for. I then created user flows for these stories.

      <p>After designing user flows, I then designed started designing <a href="images/Baksa-LF.pdf">low fidelity wireframes</a> using Balsamiq. I created four versions of the home page for baksa in which I played around with different spatial placements of the various elements.</p>

     <p>By now, I had an idea on how baksa will be roughly structured. I then created <a href="images/Baksa-MF.pdf">medium fidelity wireframes</a>in gray scale and uploaded them onto peek to understand how users perceived them. I received very positive feedback. The user appreciated the clean design and focused on how clean the hero page looked. The usability test results motivated me to go ahead and I created the <a href="images/Baksa-HF.pdf">high fidelity wireframes</a> for baksa by adding color and content to it.</p>

  <p>I deployed baksa on Gitbhub after coding it using HTML and CSS. I had to use media queries to make it responsive which was another challenge that I had to overcome. I ran into several problems with media queries, especially because I was developing on a retina display. I eventually learnt Chrome's testing tools and figured out how to test the design in different screen sizes, which made my testing lot easier.</p>

  <p>Baksa was the first project that I completed as part of my bootcamp with Bloc. It was a great learning experience for me. I used design tools like Balsamiq, Sketch, Photoshop, and Illustrator for the very first time. I employed various research methods and fused my results into the design process. I also learnt to write HTML and CSS along with the media queries. In addition, I became more comfortable the terminal and also learnt to version control my code using git and github. All in all, I learnt a lot while creating baksa and the confidence that I developed from working on baksa helped me hone my skills in future projects.</p>
