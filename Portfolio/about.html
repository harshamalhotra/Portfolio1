		<p>I am a UX Designer who wants to make the world a better place by creating design solutions that can help the people solve their problems, no matter how small or big the problems are.</p>

		<p>My curiosity and drive towards gaining knowledge has taken me to various places. I moved to the United States from a small town in India after spending 24 years of my life there. While completing my degree in Computer Science Engineering in India, I developed a skill which consists of generating ideas that can help solving problems. I also did my Masters in Business Administration with a major in Marketing. This changed my perspective about the world. I learnt about customer-centered processes and conducted a lot of research studies using quantitive and qualitative approaches. It also helped me understanding the real world problems of people and how they deal with them. I moved to the US after I got married and worked in Google’s Self driving car project.  My experience there was amazing as I worked with very talented people and learnt how to work in a fast paced environment. I also mentored four associates and helped them to get onboard with the team processes.</p>

		<p>I beleive that UX is a perfect combination for my enthusiasm for gaining insights about the various products and my talent for empathizing with people and producing real solutions for them. I am currently enrolled in Bloc.io’s  UX Design Apprenticeship program. This is where I am learning new techniques and trying to synthesize my knowledge to create highly usable products. Design is more than just how something looks, more than how it functions. It is about creating an emotional relational with the user and understanding them to make the experience delightful for them.</p>
