  <p>In the first stage, I conducted a <a href="images/Baksa-Comp-analysis.pdf">competitive analysis </a>among Evernote, Google Keep and Things. Next, I wanted to understand my potential users. The key goal was here to become familiar with the potential users and determine their requirements. I created a survey and asked them questions about how they were currently saving their content and writing content.I gained a lot of useful information through all the responses of participants. Some of the most important insights that I gained for my application are as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The website needs to be responsive because all the potential users were using their laptop and their smartphones to manage their content.</li>
    <li>The website needs to autosave and should be able to save the changes made to their content synchronously.</li>
    <li>The website needs to simple to use so that the users can focus on their work instead of learning to figure out the product.</li>
    <li>My website should have a social sign on because all of my respondents agreed to sign in through their other accounts as it saves time.</li>
    <li>I also found out that reminders can be a possible features that I can incorporate in this product in the future.</li>
  </ul> 
  <p>I gathered information from my potential users and prepared user personas.

  <p>I wanted my product to be identified as a box to store all the content. It should be able to store images and text. I played all around with various variations of the word “box” and decided to call it “baksa”. A box is called “baksa” in hindi. </p>
  <p>I wanted baksa to have a vibe which is professional, trustworthy and slightly playful to engage the users. I decided to use Helvetica Neue and Garamond as font families, both of which are classic fonts and are in complete harmony with each other.</p>

      <p>After designing user flows, I then designed started designing <a href="images/Baksa-LF.pdf">low fidelity wireframes</a> using Balsamiq. I created four versions of the home page for baksa in which I played around with different spatial placements of the various elements.</p>

      <p>I then conducted a preference test with 10 people. Seven out of ten people preferred version 1 of the hero page. I kept the first one for the low fidelity wireframe and then  went ahead and created the other low fidelity wireframes for baksa.  </p>

      <p>By now, I had an idea on how baksa will be roughly structured. I then created <a href="images/Baksa-MF.pdf">medium fidelity wireframes </a>by adding content to it.

      <p>I then uploaded my medium fidelity prototype onto peek to understand how users perceived it. I received very positive feedback. The user appreciated the clean design and focused on how clean the hero page looked.   </p>

      <p>The usability test results motivated me to go ahead and I created the <a href="images/Baksa-HF.pdf">high fidelity wireframes</a> for baksa by adding color and content to it. </p>

  <p>I deployed baksa on Gitbhub after coding it using HTML and CSS. Baksa was supposed to be a responsive website. The use of media queries to facilitate the responsiveness was another challenge that I had to overcome. While testing my code in Chrome on a retina display, I had a lot of problems. I then ultimately figured out that Chrome has testing tools which can test the way baksa will look in different displays.</p>

  <p>The users thought that they would like to have more functionality in the product. They also wanted the sign out option to be more visible.</p>

  <p>Baksa was the first project that I had completed at Bloc. It was a great learning curve for me. I used softwares like Balsamiq, Sketch, Photoshop and Illustrator for the very first time. I also used HTML and CSS to deploy baksa on github. </p>
  <p>While creating medium fidelity wireframes, using Illustrator was a great challenge for me. To include responsiveness by using media queries in css, was another trial for me. </p>
  <p>I feel I could have reached the final stage of coding much faster, if I would have skipped the step of creating medium fidelity wireframes. All in all, creating baksa infused a lot of confidence in me and taught me to use a lot of design tools.</p>
