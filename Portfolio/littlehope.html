		<p>While it is great to write a check to a large non-profit when we are feeling generous, it is often much more satisfying to direct our funds to a specific individual or a family who might be needing help.</p>
    	<p>Little hope is a web-application that attempts to help kids who need help, all around the world. It allows people to raise funds by running crowd-funding fundraisers for children related causes (e.g. medical, education). It also allows people to browse and donate to any open fundraisers. </p>

	<!-- SCOPE-->
<div class="text-row row">
	<div class="topic-title title-font col-md-12 col-lg-12">Scope</div>
</div>	
<div class="text-row row">
	<div class="topic-desc desc-font col-md-12 col-lg-12">
		To design a web application that allows users to:
		<ul>
      		<li>Create a fundraiser for kids-related projects</li>
      		<li>Browse various active fundraisers and donate to them</li>
      		<li>Stay connected and get updates from the fundraisers that they donated to</li>
      		<li>To design the website, such that in addition to being functional, it also inspires trust and generosity from the users and makes them feel good about helping others</li>	
    	</ul>

    	<p>We want to do all this while inspiring the user trust and making their experience easy and delightful.</p>

	<!-- COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS-->
<div class="text-row row" id="lhresearch">
	<div class="topic-title title-font col-md-12 col-lg-12">Competitive Analysis</div>
</div>	
<div class="text-row row">
	<div class="topic-desc desc-font col-md-12 col-lg-12">
		<p>I conducted a competitive analysis to understand the product offerings of three products in the fundraising space — Kickstarter, IndieGoGo, and Crowdfunder. I did this by using these myself, reading news reports about their products and reading reviews on the app store. Here are some of my findings:</p>
	</div>

<div class="photo-row text-row row">
	<div class="app-image col-md-12">
		<img class="img-responsive" src="images/lh-comp-analysis.png">
	</div>
</div>
<div class="text-row row">
	<div class="topic-desc desc-font col-md-12 col-lg-12">
		<ul>
			<li>Kickstarter is typically used to raise funds by innovators (e.g. artists, photographers, engineers). In general, it is a clear market leader with much stronger brand recognition. It is very popular and it will be difficult for a new product to replace it.</li>
	  		<li>Indiegogo considers itself a place where entrepreneurial projects come to life – amplified by a community of backers who believe the world benefits when every idea gets an equal chance of succeeding.</li>
	  		<li>Crowdfunder considers it self the leader in equity crowdfunding. It is mostly for finding deals to invest in and getting direct access to CEO's. As such, it turned out to be the least related to my project.</li>
	  		<li>Entry point in IndieGoGo's UI is the flow to setup a fundraiser whereas the entry point into Kickstarter is the UI to donate.</li>
	  		<li>Fundraisers in KickStarter don't go live right after creation. Instead they are first approved by KickStarter which can take upto a few days. Based on reviews, it seems that fundraisers with small funding goals aren't approved.</li>
	  		<li>IndieGogo offers low funding goals which can lead to high success rates of many small scale fundraisers.</li>
	  		<li>Users weren't very happy with the experience of mobile apps for all the products.</li>
	  		<li>I personally experienced that projects that had a strong project story were lot more effective. I also felt that the quality of images/video made a big difference.</li>
	  	</ul>

	<!-- RESEARCH-->
<div class="text-row row">
	<div class="topic-title title-font col-md-12 col-lg-12">Survey</div>
</div>	
<div class="text-row row">
	<div class="topic-desc desc-font col-md-12 col-lg-12">
		<p>In my next step, I ran a Craigslist survey to understand what my potential users better. The filter question of the survey filtered off all those people who had not recently fundraised/donated to a charity either online or offline. I finally got 23 people to answer my questionnaire. Here are some of my main findings:</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="photo-row text-row row">
	<div class="app-image col-md-offset-1 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
		<img class="img-responsive" src="images/lh-research.png">
	</div>
</div>	
<div class="text-row row">
	<div class="topic-desc desc-font col-md-12 col-lg-12">
		<ul>
			<li>Some even technically savvy users were visiting physical offices of NGOs to donate, mostly because they could not trust an online product with charity money. Having a real person that they could speak to in a brick and mortar store gave them assurance.</li>
       		<li>Some of the respondents mentioned that they valued being able to track the progress of the project through project websites, emails, receipts, and Facebook groups.</li>
        	<li>Some people also expressed frustration on not being able to find the project page after it expired.</li>
        	<li>When asked about their motivations to donate, people mentioned many different but related reasons like karma, recognition, happiness, and satisfaction. Overall, it appeared that donating made people feel good about themselves.</li>
		</ul>
		
	</div>
</div>

<!-- INTERVIEWS-->
<div class="text-row row">
	<div class="topic-title title-font col-md-12 col-lg-12">Interviews</div>
</div>	
<div class="text-row row">
	<div class="topic-desc desc-font col-md-12 col-lg-12">
		<p>I also did an in-person interview with 3 people who were involved in organizing fundraisers for the last 10 years to better understand the world from the perspective of people who fundraise. All three of them shared an interesting observation — they all initially started collected funds from everybody, but over the years they found that a core group of their contacts collectively donated large sums for all the events.</p>
    	<p>Another interesting that the interviewers told me was that many people felt uncomfortable about other people finding out their donation amount. Some people also preferred to keep their whole donation anonymous.  My conclusion from this was that people should be able to donate anonymously and that it should also be possible to just hide their donation amount. </p>

</div>	

	<!-- DESIGN GOALS-->
<div class="text-row row">
	<div class="topic-title title-font col-md-12 col-lg-12">Design Goals</div>
</div>	
<div class="text-row row">
	<div class="topic-desc desc-font col-md-12 col-lg-12">
		<p>Based on the competitive analysis and the survey research, I concluded that I should have the following broad design goals:</p>

		<p><strong>I. Inspiring donor trust in the product such that they feel comfortable donating their money.</strong> 
		<p>Here are some product design choices that I made based on this:</p>
      	<ul>
        	<li>Donors should be able to track the progress of the project</li>
        	<li>The project page (along with the progress) should not vanish even after the fundraising goal has been met.</li>
        	<li>Donors should be able to send a personal message to the organizer of the fundraiser if needed.</li>
        	<li>People should use their real name through out the project.</li>
        	<li>Creators of fundraisers should be equipped with tools to build a powerful brand story projects to help potential donors know the specific kid they are helping.</li>
        	<li>People should be able to add comments on the project pages</li>
        </ul>
      	</p>
      	<p><strong>II. Making people feel good about themselves for participating in a charity.</strong>
      	<p> Some product choices that come out of it:</p>
      	<ul>
        	<li>Product should allow and encourage people to create a compelling and genuine story, for example using high quality pictures to evoke strong emotion of helping someone.</li>
        	<li>Fundraiser organizers should be able to send personalized thank you notes to donors.</li>
        	<li>A list of donors should be prominently featured on the project page.</li>
        	<li>Visual branding and identity of the website should radiate well-being.</li>
      	</ul> 
      	</p>
      	<p>And finally, Little Hope should work across all the platforms — website, mobile apps and even tablets like iPads. I decided to accomplish this by building a responsive website.</p>

<!-- WIREFRAMES-->
<div class="text-row row" id="lhwireframes">
	<div class="topic-title title-font col-md-12 col-lg-12">Wireframes</div>
</div>	


<div class="text-row row">
	<div class="topic-desc desc-font col-md-12 col-lg-12">
		<p>I then started creating low fidelity wireframes to flesh out the high level navigation and content placement.  As part of this, I had to answer an important product question — which out of  “Donate” and “Start a project” should be the primary call-to-action. To answer this question, I went through my research notes again and saw that people who were creating fundraisers were inherently motivated and ready to spend time and energy to build a project. The action of donation on the other hand was much lighter weight and people were more likely to drop out and not complete the process if it required unnecessary time or energy. Based on this, I decided that the primary call-to-action would be for donation with a goal of making the donation process as easy as possible. I incorporated this decision in my <a href="images/LH-LF.pdf">low fidelity wireframes.</a></p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="photo-row text-row row">
	<div class="app-image col-md-offset-3 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
		<a href="#"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/lh-wf1.png"></a>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="text-row row">
	<div class="topic-desc desc-font col-md-12 col-lg-12">
		<p>Once my low fidelity wireframes were ready, I simply took some print outs and asked some family and friends to perform the tasks of donation and of creating a project. My users found the process of donation to be easy but the process of building a project seemed too take too long with a lot of information to fill-in.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="photo-row text-row row">
	<div class="app-image col-md-offset-3 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
		<a href="#"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/lh-wf2.png"></a>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="text-row row">
	<div class="topic-desc desc-font col-md-12 col-lg-12">
		<p>On the basis of the feedback, I considered cutting down the steps and the information required to build a project. But when I went back to look at the results of my research, I found a conflicting finding that users wanted lot of of information about a fundraiser before donating. This created an interesting trade-off which I kept in the mind while designing my <a href="images/LH-MF.pdf">medium fidelity wireframes</a>. I ended up reducing one step from the flow as well as making other visual changes to reduce the effort required to complete the flow (e.g. I changed one dropdown to a single tap on pre-selected categories)</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="photo-row text-row row">
	<div class="app-image col-md-offset-1 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">

	</div>
</div>

<div class="text-row row">
	<div class="topic-desc desc-font col-md-12 col-lg-12">
		<p>However when I did another round of usability testing with friends, I realized that this was still a problem and I needed to find a solution for it quickly. In the end, I decided that I did not want to reduce the amount of information but instead focus on making the process of creating a project lighter weight through UX/Visual design. The main change I made from previous iterations was to collect all the details in a single page so that it doesn’t feel too much work. I also thought that we could avoid a signed-in user having to fill in personal information again and again. I created my next set of <a href="images/LH-HF1.pdf">high fidelity wireframes</a> keeping this in mind. In this iteration, the user still needs to go step by step. The difference is that the tabs collapse and expand in the same page making the action feel much lighter.</p>

</div>

<div class="text-row row">
	<div class="topic-desc desc-font col-md-12 col-lg-12">
		<p>I then conducted a usability test and got some interesting results. While I did not get much feedback on the flow this time, interestingly enough, I got some feedback on the product name. I had initially named the project “Little People”, thinking that the name represent “kids”. However, one of my testers thought that the website was for people with dwarfism. In hindsight it made a lot of sense even though I hadn't thought of it earlier.  I then changed the name to “Little Hope” to represent the “hope” in a little kid to be helped and saved. I also redesigned the logo that I had initially designed.</p>

		<p>I also ended up creating a new version of the <a href="images/LH-HF2.pdf">high-fidelity wireframes</a> with a different color palette. I also did a preference test on the color them.

		<p>Little Hope definitely taught me a lot about the intricacies of raising funds for charity. However, the most important learning for me happened when I was trying to reduce the overhead of creating a fundraiser. This forced me to think deeply about the product and visual design choices. As part of this project, I also developed a deeper appreciation for the problem of fostering trust in online communities.</p>
