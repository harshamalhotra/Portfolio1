<div class =" try row">
  <div class="desc-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
  <p> I conducted a competitive analysis to get a broad perspective on what the product offerings of similar products are. I looked at websites of Kickstarter, IndieGoGo and Crowdfunder and compared them. </p>
  </div>
</div>


    <div class="comp-image image col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">

<div class =" try row">
      <div class="para-2 desc-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
  <p>The differentiating factor in Kickstarter is that it is the market leader and many people know about it. It is very popular and it will be difficult for a new product to replace it. Kickstarter has a large community and crowdfunder has a limited number of people in its community. IndieGoGo had no community, which I think puts a strain on the project creators to use their own community for generating funds. IndieGogo has a neat interface and also offers low funding goals which can lead to high success rates of many small scale campaigns.</p>
  <p>What the three competitors really need to work are their mobile websites/apps. They do not have good ones and for a good reason. They are content heavy and are difficult for creators to manage the websites. The videos content should also be of good quality and highest quality will have to be maintained. </p>
  <p>I feel that Little Hope should have the following features on the basis of my study:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It should be Mobile First.</li>
    <li>It should have good quality videos.</li>
    <li> The creators of the projects should be equipped with tools to build a powerful brand story. Personalized storytelling  through blog posts, interactive media, social media should be easily available.</li>
    <li> I noticed that the information  am going to aim for minimalistic approach so that the website looks more inviting.</li>
    <li>I think credibility is a problem in all of the websites. I expect Little Hope to display negative reviews as well. This means that curating comments will be a major task as well. I would want my users to be able to access failed projects as well, so that they can come back and look at what happened.

  <!-- RESEARCH  -->

  </div>
<div class =" try row">
  <div class="desc-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
  <p>In my next step, I asked 23 people to answer my questionnaire. The goal of this step was to get a perspective of the potential users of the website and to understand they are currently donating and collecting funds for special causes.</p>
 </div>
  <div class="survey-image image col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
      <img src="images/lh-research.png" />

<div class =" try row">  
      <div class="res-para desc-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
        <p>The experience gave me a glimpse of how my potential users were creating fundraisers and donating for various causes. Some of my findings were as follows:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Not new to technology:</strong></p>
        <p>From the responses, I found out that my potentials users were currently using websites like GoFundMe, GiveForward, change.org, IndieGoGo, Fundly, Kickstarter and many local website to donate. Many donors were donating in person. This made clear to me, that the potential users did utilize online tools to donate. </p>

        
        <p><strong>Able to track progress:</strong></p>
        <p>Some of the respondents mentioned that they like to track the progress of the project through project websites, emails, receipts and the facebook groups.  Thus Little Hope should be able to let the donors track the progress of the project and should be able to contact the organizer of the fundraiser. Also sometimes the donors are unable to find the project page when the project expires. They did not like that. This prompted me to make sure that even if the goal of the project is achieved, the project page will not vanish from Little Hope.</p>
       

        <p><strong>Transparent:</strong></p>
        <p>Many donors claimed that transparency is a big concern for them and comes as a roadblock for them. Little Hope should be able to employ a style which encourages people to communicate and should be simple to use. This can remove some doubts in the minds of the donors and they only focus on their donation.</p>


        <p><strong>Reasons to donate:</strong></p>
        <p>I asked what results do people expect after they donate. Many  people mentioned karma, recognition, happiness, satisfaction and other intrinsic benefits. To make the donor feel good about themselves, a personalized thank you note by the organizer of a project will give them a good experience. Also a list of donors in the form of a scroll list will be available to make the donors feel delighted to see their name in the list.</p>

  <p>I also spoke to 3 people who were involved in organizing fundraisers for the last 10 years and got their opinions about their current methods of fundraising. All three of them did mention that they initially started collected funds for charity from everybody, but then over the years they have created a group of contacts who donate large sums for all the events. They do approach other people asking for funds, but the total amount that is collected is never very high. Most of the time people feel shy and don’t want to reveal the amount that they can donate. </p>
  <p>I figured out that Little Hope should be able to able to contact friends. These friends can be contacted by using the donor’s friend list on social media channels. Therefore, the project should be shareable on social media channels like facebook and twitter. Also since many people do not want to reveal the amount that they want to donate, an option to donate anonymously should also be there.</p>

    In the next step, I created the sketches to display the content placement in Little Hope. I wanted to focus on navigation and understand the way the user will traverse the site. I then had to answer a product related question. I wanted to understand whether I would want the “Donate” or the “build a project” to be as the most important call of action.</p>
    <p>I went through my research notes again and saw that people who were creating fundraisers were ready to spend resources, namely time and energy to build a project. As compared to the action of donation, many people tend to drop out and complete the process if the process of donation requires a lot of time and energy. The goal here was to create the process of donation easier. I tried to incorporate that in <a href="images/LH-LF.pdf">low fidelity wireframes.</a></p>
    </div>
</div>
    <div class="wf1 wf-image image col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
          <img src="images/lh-wf1.png" />
    </div> 
<div class =" try row">
    <div class="para2 desc-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
      <p>Then I simply some took print outs of the low fidelity wireframe and asked some family and friends to perform the task of donation and creating a project.</p>
      <p>The users thought that the process of donation looked simple but the process of building a project seemed too take too long with a lot of information to fill. </p>
</div>
    </div>
    <div class="wf2 wf-image image col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
          <img src="images/lh-wf2.png" />
    </div>    
 <div class =" try row">   
    <div class="para3 desc-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
     <p>On the basis of the feedback, I considered cutting down the steps required to build a project which required a bunch of steps to fill in a lot of information about their cause. The only problem with this was it was conflicting with my initial research results where the potential user wanted a sizeable amount of information regarding a project before donating money to the cause.</p>
     <p>I kept this in mind while designing my <a href="images/LH-MF.pdf">medium fidelity wireframes</a>.</p>
 </div> 
    </div>  
     <div class="wf3 wf-image image col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">

<div class =" try row">
     <div class="para4 desc-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
     <p>I realized this was still a problem and I needed to find a solution for it quickly. I thought about it and in the end decided to reduce the number of pages and just simply ask the project organizer to give her details in one page so that it doesn’t look too much of work. Also I thought it will be easy for her to at least avoid entering personal information in the form, if she is already signed in. I created my next set of <a href="images/LH-HF1.pdf">high fidelity wireframes </a>keeping this in mind. </p>
</div>  
    </div> 
     <div class="wf4 wf-image image col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
          <img src="images/lh-wf4.png" />

<div class =" try row">
      <div class="para5 desc-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
     <p>In this, the the fundraiser organizer needs to go step by step. The difference is that the tabs will collapse and expand in the same page and the user can easily fill up the information in the same page, without getting a feeling that too much work is being done by her. Also it will encourage her to give relevant information for the project.</p>

    <div class="wf5 wf-image image col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">

     <p>I then conducted a usability test, and got some interesting results. I had initially named the project “Little People”, thinking that the website will simply represent “kids” in our society. One of my testers asked that when she saw the word “little people”, she thought that the website was for people with dwarfism. I did not mean to be disrespectful but I didn’t know this reference. </p>
     <p>I then changed the name to “Little Hope” to represent the “hope” in a little kid to be helped and saved. I redesigned the logo that I had initially designed. </p>
     <p>Since I was already redesigning the style template, I also conducted a preference test between the orange theme and the green-blue theme and created a <a href="images/LH-HF2.pdf">new version of the high fidelity wireframes</a>.</p>

    <p>Majority of my testers preferred the green- blue screen as compared to the orange theme.

    <p>Little Hope has taught me the importance of testing. It was initially named “Little People”. If one of my testers had not casually mentioned in one of her feedback sessions about how people with dwarfism are addressed as “little people”, the product would have been an embarrassment. Along with testing, I also learnt the intricacies and the processes of people who have working in the NGO industry raising and helping thousands of people in the world.
