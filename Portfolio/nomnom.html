		<p>The food truck industry has grown rapidly in the past years and there are no good ways of tracking and contacting local food trucks. According to my research, people depend on apps like Twitter to stay connected with their favorite food trucks, even though the user experience is arguably sub-par.</p>
    	<p>The mobile nature of the food trucks presents unique needs for the food truck owners and their customers. I believe that this problem can be solved by building a mobile app.</p>
   		<p>Nom nom is an iOS app using which users can locate food trucks around them, find out about the services offered by them, and place their food order.</p>

		 <p>Yelp provided useful information (e.g. in reviews) though the experience of placing an order was not good. Grubhub’s payment process was very smooth though it did not have many reviews. Roaming Hunger Food Truck Finder, while was a niche product more narrowly focused the food truck industry, it still wasn’t well designed across the board. Overall, my main conclusion was that all three of these left something to be desired.</p>

		 <p>Next, I wanted to understand what the users were looking for in their food truck experience. To accomplish this, I posted a Craigslist ad for a survey questionnaire containing around 10 qualitative questions. The filter question of the survey filtered off anyone who had not used a food truck in the last two months. Finally, I collected responses from around 20 people. </p>

	<div class="topic-desc desc-font col-md-12 col-lg-12">
		<p>This helped me understand my potential users and their pain points in ordering food from the food trucks. Some of my findings were as follows:</p>
  
  		<p><strong>Importance of exploration and difficulty in locating and tracking food trucks</strong></p>
    	<p>This was one of the most important concerns for many people. Many people mentioned that they wanted to explore new and diverse food trucks. However, people had no good way to find new local food trucks. They also had no good way to track their favorite food trucks since food trucks often change their location.  </p>
  			<blockquote><i>Hard to know location and might not be at the same place regularly.</i></blockquote>
  		<p>My conclusions from knowing this were
    	<ul>
      		<li>Users should be able to search for food trucks in any area.</li>
      		<li>They should have a way to track some of their favorite food trucks.</li>
    	</ul> 
  		</p>
  
  		<p><strong>Long wait times</strong></p>
  		<p>Many people pointed out that during busy periods (e.g. office lunch break), there would often be a long line of customers outside the food truck. Further they preferred not to wait for a long time - either way, it made their experience worse. </p>
  			<blockquote><i>Food trucks are very popular where I work in downtown San Francisco and if you're not out there early during lunch hours, the lines are too long and it takes up too much of my lunch hour waiting around to get my food.</i></blockquote>
  		<p>My conclusion from this was — users of the app should be able to place an order remotely using the app so that they can only go to pick up their food and minimize their waiting time. </p>
  		<p><strong>Cash only payment</strong></p>
  		<p>Some people mentioned that many food trucks accepted only cash payments even though they usually don't don't carry cash and certainly not exact change. Some also mentioned that they preferred using a credit card so as to be able to accurately track their personal expenses.</p>
  
  			<blockquote><i>This is the 21st century. We don’t keep hard cash on us anymore. We even get paid digitally. We should be able to buy a burrito digitally.</i></blockquote>

  		<p>From this, I concluded that people should be able to pay digitally using the app itself.  </p>

		<p>After my interviews, it was clear to me that even though there were many common themes in what people wanted, there were also some noticeable differences. For instance, some people prefer to go to the same food truck and just want to reduce the hassle in the ordering process whereas some others want to explore new food trucks. As another example, different people valued different things about a food truck — from reviews and pictures to and prices and hygiene.</p>
  		<p>To ensure that my designs were appropriate for a diverse user base, I decided to develop the following <a href="images/Persona-Nomnom.pdf">personas</a> based on the data collected from my surveys. </p>

		<p>I wanted to make the app look approachable and trustworthy with a casual and fun tone. And so:</p>
  		<ul>
  			<li>I designed the logo to look like a food truck because I thought that it will help establish a clearer association with the target market of food trucks. </li>
  			<li>It is a well known fact that the red color evokes strong emotions and encourages appetite and hence like most food apps, I designed Nom Nom to also be in a red theme. Rest of the colors in the palette were chosen to make the app look warm and fun. </li>
  			<li>I chose Lato font for the content because its semi-rounded details of the let­ters give it a feel­ing of warmth, while the strong struc­ture pro­vides sta­bil­ity and seri­ous­ness. I chose Varela Round for headings because its rounded corners make it perfect for a soft feel and works great at any size.</li>

		<p>After my interviews, it was clear that the needs of a wide variety of users had to be considered. I then decided to develop the following personas to keep in mind the needs of the users of the app.</p>

		<p>I then created a mock user story to better empathize with my end users. This helped me understand how the users will approach the app and how they will traverse through the entire process of ordering and procuring food from a food truck. I learnt several things about the desired experience from doing this — for instance, I realized that the app should support some push notifications for important events like their order being ready</p>

<div class="text-row row">
	<div class="topic-desc desc-font col-md-12 col-lg-12">
		<p>I then started designing the <a href="images/Nom-LF.pdf">low fidelity wireframes</a>. One challenge I ran into at multiple places was prioritizing what information/controls to show and what to hide while maximizing the usability and minimizing the visual clutter. To resolve this, I did some card sorting with my friends and family to understand how they prioritized various pieces of information about a food truck. I also referenced the personas I had developed.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="photo-row text-row row">
	<div class="app-image col-md-offset-1 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">

<div class="text-row row">
	<div class="topic-desc desc-font col-md-12 col-lg-12">
		<p>
      I then incorporated results from the card sorting into the low fidelity wireframes uploaded them onto peek to understand how users perceived it in general. Unfortunately, I got some feedback that wasn't useful since the reviewer was not in a frame of mind to review a low fidelity wireframe, and instead focused mostly on the lack of polish. This helped me better understand the conditions under which a remote user-testing can be more useful.</p>
      <p>Since doing remote testing on low fidelity wireframes wasn't working, I simply some took its print outs and asked some friends to order some food using the paper mockup. The main learning was about the landing page — I had designed it to be a Google-like giant search bar where people could enter any query. However, people hesitated in typing anything in because they did not understand it well. Based on this, I decided to change the landing page to be a visual map-based search (similar to Airbnb or Yelp). Besides this, I also learnt that the they wanted to use search filters and had some issues identifying the list icon. Other than that, it seemed that the users were quite successful in understanding the app and performing the task of ordering some food. This gave me confidence in my approach and so I proceeded with preparing the <a href="images/Nom-HF.pdf">high fidelity wireframes</a> in Sketch. </p>

		<p>I’m proud of the work I accomplished with Nom nom. It was a lot of fun learning the nuances of designing for iOS and creating an exclusively mobile experience for users. I think the biggest takeaway for me though was how much I grew by challenging myself to try new ideas and get uncomfortable in the process. From expanding my user research skills, to testing out new tools, to diving into the deep end of branding development, this experience has only strengthened that urge to jump into new challenges as a designer.</p>
