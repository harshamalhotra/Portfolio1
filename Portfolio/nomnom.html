   <div class ="try row">
    <div class="desc-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12"> <p>The food truck industry has grown exponentially in the past years and there are no good ways of tracking and contacting local food trucks, especially in big cities. According to my research, people depend on apps like Twitter to stay connected with their favorite food trucks, even though the user experience is arguably sub-par. </p>
    <p>The mobile nature of the food trucks presents unique needs for the food truck owners and their customers. This problem can be solved by building a mobile app.
    </p>
    <p>Nom nom is an iOS app using which users can locate food trucks around them, find out about the services offered by them, and place their food order.</p>

<div class =" try row">
  <div class="desc-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
  <p>The first step was to understand the current market conditions and the current players operating in the sphere. So I did a <a href="images/Nom-Comp-analysis.pdf">SWOT analysis </a>of three potential competitors - Yelp, Grubhub and Roaming Hunger Food Truck Finder. </p>
  </div>
</div>


    <div class="comp-image image col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">

    </div> 
<div class =" try row">
      <div class="para-2 desc-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
  <p>My main conclusion was that all three of these left something to be desired. Yelp provided good information though the experience of placing an order was pretty bad. Grubhub’s payment process was very smooth though it did not have many reviews. Roaming Hunger Food Truck Finder, while more closely aligned with my problem statement, still wasn’t well designed across the board.</p>

 <!-- INTERVIEWS -->

  </div>
<div class =" try row">
  <div class="desc-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
  <p>The second step of undertaking this project was to understand what the users were looking for in their food truck experience. To do this, I spoke with around 20 people and asked them fairly open ended questions about their experience with food trucks. 
 </p>
  </div>
</div>
  <div class="interview-image image col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
      <img src="images/nomnom-interview.png" />
    </div> 
<div class =" try row">
      <div class="int-para desc-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
  <p>The experience gave me a glimpse of how my potential users were currently dealing with food trucks. Some of my findings were as follows:</p>
  
  <p><strong>Difficulty in locating favorite food trucks:</strong></p>
  <p>This was one of the most important concerns for many people. People are unable to find food trucks in their area. They are also unable to track their favorite food trucks as they change location. This meant that the user should be given an option to track the location of the food truck. </p>
  <i>Hard to know location and might not be at the same place regularly.</i>
  
  <p><strong>Long wait times:</strong></p>
  <p>Many food trucks customers pointed out that during the rush hour times, there is often a long line of customers outside the food truck. It becomes difficult for the user to wait for a huge amount of time making the entire process of procuring food difficult. As a result, they will like to be able to find food trucks with less waiting time, as well as make an order remotely using the app. </p>
  <i>Food trucks are very popular where I work in downtown San Francisco and if you're not out there early during lunch hours, the lines are too long and it takes up too much of my lunch hour waiting around to get my food.</i>

  <p><strong>No advance pay</strong></p>
  <p>People mentioned that many food trucks accept only cash. With the usage of credit cards increasing everyday, customers find it hard to pay only via cash and not pay through credit or debit cards.They also mention that by using a credit card, the tracking of their personal transactions becomes easier.</p>
  <i>This is the 21st century. We don’t keep hard cash on us anymore. We even get paid digitally. We should be able to buy a burrito digitally.</i>

  <p>From these results, I gathered that customers of food trucks needed a design solution which let them look for their food trucks easily, reduce their wait times and also let them pay using credit cards in advance. </p>

  <p>After my interviews, it was clear that the needs of a wide variety of users had to be considered. I then decided to develop the following <a href="images/Persona-Nomnom.pdf">personas</a> to keep in mind the needs of the users of the app. </p>

  <p>Through my initial brand exploration, I wanted the tone of the project to be “warm”, and “full of energy”. I prepared the assets of the products by designing the logo of Nom Nom simply as a “food truck”. It is also a well known fact that the red color increases appetite and hence like almost all food apps, I wanted Nom Nom to also be in a red theme. Broadly speaking, I chose the color palette and the font family with a goal to make the app look simple and approachable.  </p>

    While designing the <a href="images/Nom-LF.pdf">low fidelity wireframes</a>, I decided to make the map view as the first page of the app after logging in because a visual representation is very suitable for hyper local search of food trucks. One challenge I ran into at multiple places was prioritizing what information/controls to show and what to hide while maximizing the usability and minimizing the visual clutter. To resolve this, I did some card sorting with my friends and family to understand how users prioritized various pieces of information about a food truck.</p>

<div class =" try row">
     <div class="wf-para desc-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
      <p>I then uploaded my low fidelity wireframes onto peek to understand how users perceived it in general. I got some really poor feedback but I realized that the reviewer was not in a frame of mind to review a low fidelity wireframe, and instead focused bulk of the feedback on lack of polish. This taught me a lesson of using the remote user testing method intelligently.</p>
      <p>Then I simply some took print outs of the low fidelity wireframe and asked some family and friends to order some food using the paper mockup. </p>
      <p>The users wanted more options in the filter window and had some issues identifying the list icon. Other than that, it seemed that the users were quite successful in understanding the app and performing the task of ordering some food. </p>
      <p>I then prepared the <a href="images/Nom-HF.pdf">high fidelity wireframes </a>in Sketch.</p>

    <p>I’m proud of the work I accomplished with Nom nom. It was a lot of fun learning the nuances of designing for iOS and creating an exclusively mobile experience for users. I think the biggest takeaway for me though was how much I grew by challenging myself to try new ideas and get uncomfortable in the process. From expanding my user research skills, to testing out new tools, to diving into the deep end of branding development, this experience has only strengthened that urge to jump into new challenges as a designer.</p>
